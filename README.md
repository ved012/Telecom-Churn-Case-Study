# Telecom-Churn-Case-Study
The telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another.  To acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. The business objective is to predict the churn in the last (i.e. the ninth) month using the data (features) from the first three months. To do this task well, understanding the typical customer behaviour during churn will be helpful.
